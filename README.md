# 🏫 School Management System (C Language)

This is a **basic School Management System** built in **C language** as my **first semester project**.  
The program is **fully terminal-based** and demonstrates core C concepts like **file handling, modular programming, and menu-driven systems**.  
It allows administrators, teachers, and students to efficiently manage and view educational records.

⚠️ **Note:**  
This is an **introductory-level project** created for **learning purposes**. It is simple, text-based, and does not use advanced data structures or databases.
